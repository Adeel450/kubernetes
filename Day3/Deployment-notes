Pod:
You run the container , to write the all things in the yaml file
A pod be a single or multiple container
Pod will not have specification Auto Healing and Auto Scaling

Interview Question:

What is the Purpose of Deployment:

IT makes the also Pod but firstly It will create Replica Set and Replica Set is a Controller then it make the Pod and also we write in the Yaml manifest



 There are benefits in deployment:
1: Auto Healing IF you set 2 replica set so it have 2 controller
2: Auto Scaling

Controler:
Actual state is always same as desire sate so it is known as Controller, There are aslo default and custom Controller
Golang language which will ensure that a specific behaviour is implemented

What is Deiifence between Deployment and Replicaset?

Replicaset is basically a Controller if pod is killed so replica controller say it will auto heal the pod
When you make the Deployment the replica set is making automatically
