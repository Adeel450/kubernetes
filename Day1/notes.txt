This is the Componenets of Worker and Maaster Node


Componenets of Worker Node:

Kubelet:
1: You make the pod similar to the Docker container , Kubelet is responsible for pod, IT will check pod is running or not , when pod is not running it will say check pod is not tunning

container-runtime:
2:  It is used to run the container  by using  container runtime , crio , containerd but in docker it use only docker shim

Kube-proxy:
3:  Kube proxy provide networking in Kubernetes like ip adreesses, load balancer

Componenets of Master Node:

API server
The core componenet of kubernets is API server, it is peresent in MAster node

What is the Purpose of the API server:
IT is  bascially exposese the kuberetes to the external world

Scheduler:
it is responsible for the sechudling your pods or sechudling you resoruces on Kubernetes

ETCD:
IT is basically acts a backup service , key value store and entire kubernetes store information, When you have restrore a cluster

Controller Manager:
There are many controllers in Kubernetes like Replica set and there has to be a program and there has a comopnent which ensure that controllers are running this is called controller Manager.

Cloud Controler Manager:
IT means like if i make the cloud which name is adeel and so we write the logic in CCM and this is not use in on premises
